# ICU-MORTALITY-PROJECT
The ICU Mortality project is a critical initiative at the intersection of healthcare and machine learning, designed to enhance patient care and outcomes within intensive care units (ICUs). The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately assesses and forecasts the likelihood of mortality for patients admitted to the ICU. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and data analytics, the model will analyze a diverse set of patient variables, including vital signs, laboratory results, medical history, and demographic information. 
By employing a comprehensive approach to feature selection and model training, we aim to create a robust and reliable tool that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients early in their ICU stay. The ultimate goal is to empower medical teams with timely and accurate information, enabling them to make more informed decisions, allocate resources efficiently, and ultimately improve patient outcomes in critical care settings.
